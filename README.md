# 🚀 Getting started :

The best way to start with this template is clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

1. `yarn prepare`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn dev`

- To view your project open `http://localhost:3000`.

To run your unit tests, use the command :

    yarn test

To run your cypress tests, use the command :

    yarn cypress

(dont forget! the app should be already running on http://localhost:3000 for your Cypress tests to run correctly)

if you're having some issues related to cypress instalation, then run this command at the root of your project folder (otherwise you can ignore this step):

    .\node_modules\.bin\cypress.cmd install
